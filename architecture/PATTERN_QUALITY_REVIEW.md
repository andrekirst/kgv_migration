## Production Readiness Assessment

### Critical Requirements Status:

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |

| Maintainability | ✅ | Clean architecture, SOLID principles |

## Specific Recommendations

### High Priority (Before Production)

1. **Complete Metrics Integration**
   ```csharp
   // In TranslationMetrics class
   public void RecordTranslationTime(string operation, long milliseconds)
   {
       _prometheusHistogram
           .WithLabels(operation)
           .Observe(milliseconds);
   }
   ```

   ```csharp
   public class ValidationBehavior<TRequest, TResponse> 
       : IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>
   {
       // Validate commands before execution
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Cache Stampede Protection**
   ```csharp
   public async Task<T> GetOrSetAsync<T>(string key, Func<Task<T>> factory)
   {
       // Use distributed lock for factory execution
       using (var distributedLock = await _lockProvider.AcquireAsync(key))
       {
           // Check cache again inside lock
           // Execute factory if still missing
       }
   }
   ```

### Medium Priority (Post-Launch)

1. **Add Request Deduplication**
